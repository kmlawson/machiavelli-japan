## Issues:

* This looks more like two different talks
* Do one or the other, or split the time in between
* Much of the audience may be more curious about the former, but just a weak talk not based on very much
* Latter has more scholarly merit but may be of less interest to audience

## To do:

* Earliest CJK translations of Machiavelli
* Read Hani Goro texts
* Read over the Chinese articles on Machiavelli
* Notes on Machiavelli scholarship from international perspective
* Look into Machiavelli and Marxism - relevant for Hani Goro material
