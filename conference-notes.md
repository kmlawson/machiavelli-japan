## Introduction to the Person of Machiavelli - Peter Stacey

* a key question for M:
    * given his celebration of republic and the general good is done there and not in principalities, then what was he up to in il principe
    * il vivere servo - condition of unfreedom in civil relations
        * unfree lives in monarchial states
        * as opposed to il vivere libero
    * thinking of M as a theorist of liberty on the basis on discourses alone
    * freedom as a stable, durable condition granting immunity against arbitrary interference into our activities
        * M seeing the state itself as fixing this
    * M must explain why so many come to love servitude
    * disagrees with scholarship that denies M has a theory of state
        * lo stato comes to be understand as a reference to the civil body
        * lo stato as a synonym with civitas
* M is always as interested in the state of servitude as he is in the state of liberty
    * ch. 1 dividing the two sorts of states
    * ch. 3 "not used to living free"
* Book 2 of discourses on empire
* connection between P1
* M distinction between wanton violence and necessary violence
    * ch 8
* no liberty in any of M's principalities
* M argues that story of Roman republic fall cannot be just a moral decline or institutional issue but some combination of both.
* M wants to destroy the nostalgia for the roman republic
* the **body of the state**:
    * book 1: ch. 11 - birth
    * book 2: 
    * book 3: the problem of corruption
        * republics, if frequently reordered, have a longer life
* three consuquences
    * brings in a stoic view
    * stoic model of self-mastery
    * comes with a very specific idea of representation
* we are urged, when elected, to become the persona of the civitas
* M strips out natural reason, social obligations, etc. radically rethinking - he has no confidence in self-mastery - all they are capable of are acts of deception

* assumptions about us:
    * we are desiring bodies
        * lots of variations on words of passion
        * we are animated by unchangeable passions
        * D1 - men will struggle over ambition at all times
            * desires always outstrip ability to acquire

* P9 on the three outcomes:
    principality, self-government, or anarchy 

* emphasis on the capacity of people to have false illusions and believe in them
    * and the dangers of this
    * reluctant to allow representation as a result
    * set on cancelling out representation throughout government

### Q & A

* McCormick
    * suspicious of the purity of principality vs. republic
    * election to life: soderini vs. roman kings
    * A: M not a purist, a pragmatic - it is a more complicated picture
* Homes
    * how does the liberty/servitude polarity connect with others, such as fortuna (you are half subjected by it and half by your own virtue)
    * what about the freedom of founders
    * what about the "freedom" to break out of a position of servility
    * A: freedom usually a predicate of the state

## Machiavelli on Family, Friendship and Sociability - Anna Becker

* How early mod pol thought handled issues that were considered private
    * especially relating family to politics
* D?.4
    * Skinner:
        * instead of concord between the classes, M saw conflict between them which was productive
    * Social life in Florence mediated by ideas of friendship
        * pervasive language of friendship
* History of concept of friendship and its importance
    * Cicero, Aristotle, Bruni
* M's taking a radical turn against the importance of friendship in his views related to concord
    * using history of Florence as example
    * M warns against distribution of favors
    * M critique of factionalism
    * friendship - leads to tyranny? not conducive for civic virtue
    * safeguards have to be created in form of institutions
