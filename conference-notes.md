## Introduction to the Person of Machiavelli - Peter Stacey

* a key question for M:
    * given his celebration of republic and the general good is done there and not in principalities, then what was he up to in il principe
    * il vivere servo - condition of unfreedom in civil relations
        * unfree lives in monarchial states
        * as opposed to il vivere libero
    * thinking of M as a theorist of liberty on the basis on discourses alone
    * freedom as a stable, durable condition granting immunity against arbitrary interference into our activities
        * M seeing the state itself as fixing this
    * M must explain why so many come to love servitude
    * disagrees with scholarship that denies M has a theory of state
        * lo stato comes to be understand as a reference to the civil body
        * lo stato as a synonym with civitas
* M is always as interested in the state of servitude as he is in the state of liberty
    * ch. 1 dividing the two sorts of states
    * ch. 3 "not used to living free"
* Book 2 of discourses on empire
* connection between P1
* M distinction between wanton violence and necessary violence

    * ch 8
* no liberty in any of M's principalities
* M argues that story of Roman republic fall cannot be just a moral decline or institutional issue but some combination of both.

* the **body of the state**:
    * book 1: ch. 11 - birth
    * book 2: 
    * book 3: the problem of corruption
        * republics, if frequently reordered, have a longer life
* three consuquences
    * brings in a stoic view
    * stoic model of self-mastery
    * comes with a very specific idea of representation
* we are urged, when elected, to become the persona of the civitas
* M strips out natural reason, social obligations, etc. radically rethinking - he has no confidence in self-mastery - all they are capable of are acts of deception

* assumptions about us:
    * we are desiring bodies
        * lots of variations on words of passion
        * we are animated by unchangeable passions
        * D1 - men will struggle over ambition at all times
            * desires always outstrip ability to acquire

* P9 on the three outcomes:
    principality, self-government, or anarchy 

* emphasis on the capacity of people to have false illusions and believe in them
    * and the dangers of this
    * reluctant to allow representation as a result
    * set on cancelling out representation throughout government

* one's own armies
    * one should not lack of (troops not mercenaries or auxiliaries)

    * populazione arme
* M's critique of mercenaries contains an implicit critique of a particular financial system
* appointment of a special investigation looking at the activities of the ten to punish those guilty of misuse of capital
* the statement "money is not the sinews of war" is tied closely to particular laws and institutions in Florence

## Florentine Diasters, Dutch Fortunes: Machiavelli, Grotius and Republican Freedom - Martin van Gelderen

* **liberal freedom** - Berlin: Two Concepts of Liberaty "the degree to which no man or body of men interferes with my activity"
* **negative liberty** - to be free from coercion, free from intervention with the choices on has decided to make
* the choices and actions of the individual person are at the heart of liberal freedom
* **John Stuart Mill On Liberty** "If a person possess any tolerable amount of common sense and experience, his own mode of laying out his existence is the best, not because it is the best in itself, but because it is his own mode."

Republican critique of this:

* alternative history of freedom
* republican freedom: I am only fully free in a situation of non-domination
* key eleemnt is freedom from any kind of domination or dependence
* freedom to govern ourselves
* strong meaning of republican freedom: in the republic of our making
* Harrington: claims this is nonsenseo

Italo-Atlantic Republican Tradition:
* Machiavelli
* 1650s Harrington in England
* 1650s De La Court in the Dutch Republic
* 18th century: American Revolution
    * James Madison
    * Thomas Jefferson

* the idea that Machiavelli et al ideas are received by these other thinkers, and then moves across the atlantic, especially to Madison and Jefferson
* Van Gelderen - the Dutch Republic, which is founded on some of these ideas
* Hugo Grotius - 

Grotius and Machiavelli
* both were republican losers
* both fought in vain to retain the republican gov
* both fought against monarchy, medici and house of orange
* both banished, Grotius banished (1619)
    * went to Paris
* both wrote main works in exile
* no engagement with M
* similar questions but no engagements

Grotius on Freedom
* "God made man autechousios" liberum suique juris
    * 1903
* "fully autonomous, free and in his own right"
* formulation of the key notion of republican freedom in sense of non-domination
* quest for origin: starts with God and creation of nature
* notion of "autexousion" - of Stoic origin and refers - the ability to act on one's own initiative
* may have found it in Epictetus or in Origen: De Principiis - had a breif piece on freedom (Peri autexousiou)
* Erasmus-Luther: bondage or freedom of human will
* Grotius's reading: emphasizing and squaring notions of autonomy
* Arminius on Freedom, Will and Providence
    * freedom as "perfect independence" - God alone
    * humans are subject to command and providence of God
    * starts analysis of human freedom with contention that God created men "free and on his own right" - Grotius suggested a very strong notion of human freedom
* Grotius on natural freedom
    * man is "naturally free"
    * libertas - natural faculty to act as one pleases
    * Grotius: concept of "natural freedom" refers to "the faculty to act"
* Freedom of Conscience
    * those aspects of mind and conscience cannot be touched
    * internal actions such as thoughts and beliefs are by nature free
    * "the better part of man" is by nature is free from slavery
    * quotes Senca often: "Only the body is at the mercy and disposition of the master"
* Grotius on Roman Law: freedom and servitude
    * humans are free men or slaves
    * to be sui iuris means to have power over oneselve
    * alienus iuris meants to be in power of someone
    * libertas is a natural faculty, servitude is a human creation
    * war and necessity may lead to servitude and monarchy
    * personal liberty excludes the Dominion of a Master, so does civil Liberty exclude royalty, and all manner of Sovereignty properly so called
* Free Republic
    * respublica - multitude of private person comes to gether to increase their mprotection through utual aid and assist each other in acquiring necessity
    * unite by way of civil contract
    * from private persons they turn themselves into cives, citizens
* Providence and Freedom
    * problems of squaring all this
    * Calvinists offer one way out
    * Thomas Hobbes *De Cive* 1637 "liberty to define it is nothing other than the absence of impediments to motion" liberty consists in motion
        * foundation of Hobbes's attack on republican freedom as a misconception
* Conclusion
    * republican freedom not only neo-Roman but also profoundly Christian, steeped in the post-Reformation debate on the freedom of will
    * little room for Machiavelli 
    * Citizen: For Grotius, republican notion of freedom as autonomy, responsibility and self-gov is built on a very strong and controversial notion of human freedom of will
    * Helps explains why Machiavelli is read throughout Europe primarily as the author of the Prince, rather than as a republican thinker.
    * plug for book: **Freedom and the Construction of Europe**

* Simon Jackson comments:
    * how is the Christian aspect of the genealogy of liberty affected by colonial slave systems - for example, scholarship on British liberalism and empire
    * how do we see Grotius and Machiavelli as authors with specific readerships 

* Grotius deeply disturbed that the battle would need to be won in the world of pamphleteering
    * you don't just need good laws but a public debate, which has elements of a certain kind of politeness and civility
    * he realized that he has no control on it
