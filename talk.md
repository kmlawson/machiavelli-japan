### Japanese Translations

-   Translations of Machiavelli into Japanese began relatively early.
    Two different translations of the Prince that came out in 1886, in
    the early Meiji period, when a flood of Western translations were
    part of a relative opening up of the country. A 1914 translation of
    the Prince gives it the name that today is sometimes used to refer
    to "Machiavellianism": 権謀術数論, literaly the strategy or ploy of
    calculating one's actions according to changing circumstances. The
    term 權變

-   The first translation of the Discourses as far as I have been able
    to determine also came relatively early in 1906 and had an unusually
    distinguised translator, Hayashi Tadasu. Hayashi completed the
    translation in 1903 which was done from an English translation (with
    reference to a French translation) rather than from the Italian.
    Only a year earlier Hayashi had his hands full negotiating the
    Anglo-Japanese alliance of 1902. He became ambassador to the UK in
    1905 would later become Japan's foreign minister the following year.
    In his introduction Hayashi emphasizes the importance of the
    Discourses in Machiavelli's thinking about republics and laments
    that only the Prince existed in translation. However, in Hayashi's
    memoirs, published during the first world war, there is little
    evidence of any impact of Machiavelli's republicanism, and the only
    reference to Machiavelli is as an adjective to describe back
    stabbing power politics.

-   A few more translations of the Prince and the Discourses emerged
    before the end of World War II but took off siginificantly in the
    1950s and thereafter.

### Chinese Translations

-   The overwhelming concentration of translations into Chinese have
    been of the Prince, and most of these have been translated from
    Marriot or Ricci English translations rather than from the original.

-   During the cultural revolution, Machiavelli's work were among the
    western works translated, again from the English for a series on
    historiography commissioned with the justification of better
    criticizing them.[^1]

-   Both translations and a growing body of secondary scholarly and
    popular writing on Machiavelli exploded after the liberalization of
    the 1980s.

-   In some recent articles on Machiavelli, China's own authoritarian
    government system can be detected hovering in the background as
    Chinese philosophers debate Machiavelli's views on princes and
    republics. As one philosopher from Qinghua University described in
    his literature review on Chinese Machiavelli scholars puts it, the
    two growingly popular positions in a debate over Machivalli argue
    either that Machiavelli's works contain a message about the need for
    a state maintain strong control over its domestic affairs in order
    to ward off foreign dangers, and an alternate school which
    emphasizes Machiavelli's praise for mixed government and the
    stability gained through popular participation in government. We can
    see in these two schools two perspectives among Chinese leaders
    today: one which emphasizes the dangers of reform, while the other
    pressing for a stronger popular voice while maintaining the strong
    leadership of the Community Party.[^2]

### Korean Translations

-   Until it emerged from Japanese colonial rule in 1945, Koreans had to
    make due with Japanese translations of Machiavelli. Even as Korean
    translations of the Prince, the first coming out in 1958 and the
    Discourses in 1972, translations have often been made from old
    versions in English rather than from the original.

-   South Korean periodical scholarship on Machiavelli, at least what I
    have seen from the 1980s covers a wide range of issues one might
    expect, but there appears to be a small side literature trying to
    apply Machiavelli's advice to princes in its negotiations with North
    Korea, while others have turned to Machiavelli's discourses for
    examples on how to prevent a recently democratized South Korea from
    losing it democratizing momentum and move beyond stagnation. Korea
    had reached, as a 2011 article recently put it, its own
    Machiavellian moment.[^3]

### Han Feizi

-   The connections between Machiavelli and East Asia are found most
    often in efforts by scholars to identify an equivalent thinker. In
    the case of Chinese history, the primary candidate is the Warring
    States period philosopher Han Fei (B.C.E. 281-), the most important
    founder of the school of thought now called Legalism. Most of the
    articles I have seen in this genre emphasize the connections between
    the two with regard to a distrust for the natural evil tendencies of
    humanity that must be guarded against, if need be with the use of
    fear and cruelty in punishment and in the need for strategem and
    calculation in political relations. Nothing I have seen in skimming
    some of this scholarship in China seems to engage with texts by
    Machiavelli other than the Prince. A recent dissertation from the
    University of Hawaii by Alejandro Pardo makes a more detailed
    historicist comparison between the two thinkers, and places far
    greater emphasis on the two respective thinkers approaches to law in
    society, in particular.[^4]

### Ogyū Sorai

-   In Japan, Machiavelli is most often compared to Ogyū Sorai, a
    confucian scholar active during the Tokugawa period from the late
    17c to the early 18c. To see how he has been used, let us consider
    two very contradictory figures in Japan found a strong connection
    with Machiavelli

-   **Yamaji Aizan** The eclectic Christian intellectual Yamaji Aizan, a
    supporter of authoritarian nationalism who formed a radical
    political party seeking to merge socialist and nationalist ideas
    after Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese war was deeply
    interested in Machiavelli.[^5] Aizan saw Machiavelli as a Western
    equivalent of Ogyū Sorai. He saw both radical political reform
    domestically and an active imperialism abroad as key elements in
    uniting society towards the end of the nation. We might recognize
    Machiavelli's critique of Italian rennaissance princes in Aizan's
    own writings about Chinese leaders. He encouraged his contemporary
    Japanese to learn from the example of Chinese leaders, whose
    effeminate weakness, together with their inability to function
    together as a cohesive unit, as their primary weaknesses.[^6]

-   **Maruyama Masao** - Maruyama, perhaps the most important Japanese
    intellectual of the twentieth century was a strong critic of wartime
    and imperial Japan. In one of his approaches to explaining Japanese
    reflections on its wartime experience, he contrasted both Ogyū Sorai
    and Machiavelli's emphasis on results rather than upon noble
    intentions with the Japanese who continued to show sympathy, even
    for convicted war criminals, because their wartime conduct was
    motivated by their national loyalties.[^7]

### Rōyama Masamichi

-   Rōyama Masamichi was political theorist, professor, and one of the
    key intellectual inspirations for Japan's wartime conception of a
    Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. During the war, from 1942,
    he served in the Japanese parliament, travelled to the Philippines
    to inspect the Japanese occupation there, and was a member of an
    important research group known as the Showa Kenkyukai which
    supported a radical political restructing of Japan on corporatist
    grounds, and debated the ways to achieve political and cultural
    unity between Japan and a China then under its occupation.

-   Rōyama was also, however, one of a handful of Japanese scholars
    thinking and writing about Machiavelli in the 1930s. In 1937, just
    as Japan embarked on full war with China, he authored an
    introduction to humanist political thought, in which Machiavelli's
    works played a central part. As with all the Japanese intellectuals
    I have mentioned here, Rōyama emphasized the importance of the
    Discourses over the broader interest in the Prince, especially in
    China. He also took pains to emphasize, from the perspect of the
    late 1930s, that one shouldn't find any contradiction between the
    republican and authoritarian tendencies within Machiavelli's works.
    He saw the Prince as merely taking up a small piece of the larger
    vision of the Discourses, that in Part III, considering strategies
    for establishing a new order in a time of cultural and social chaos.
    Only a few years later, in 1941, Rōyama would go on to write his own
    take on how to build a new order in a time of chaos with his work
    "East Asia And the World: Discourses on the Way to New Order"
    (東亜と世界 : 新秩序への論策).

### Hani Gorō

-   After the second world war, Rōyama Masamichi was briefly purged for
    his connections to the wartime government but soon continued both
    his scholarly and political life. He became a strong supporter of
    the more conservative wing of the socialist party, which eventually
    formed its own social-democratic party in the 1960s.

-   Another important Japanese intellectual who found inspiration in
    Machiavelli and studied him closely was Hani Gorō. After studying in
    Heidelberg in the 1920s, Hani returned to Japan and become a leading
    Marxist intellectual. He published a Marxist journal together with
    Miki Kiyoshi, another Marxist who would, together with Rōyama
    Masamichi later develop into a passionate supporter for a Greater
    East Asia under Japanese guardianship. He was dismissed from an
    academic position in 1928 for his leftist writings, and arrested in
    1933 for violating Japan's draconian Peace Preservation Act.
    Released again, like many mid-20c Japanese intellectuals, including
    Maruyama Masao, he turned away from the study of contemporary Japan
    to find lessons in history. Whereas Maruyama wrote about political
    thought in Japan's earlier Tokugawa period, Hani wrote about
    Rennaissance Italy, and in the 1930s produced both an introductory
    essay and a longer volume introducing Machiavelli's thought. Hani's
    real career wouldn't come until after the war, when he could openly
    join a Communist party that would eventually find him insufficiently
    dogmatic. Hani was elected to the postwar parliament, helped found
    Japan's teacher's union which is still one of the most powerful
    political forces in Japan today, and also played the most important
    role in reforming and expanding Japan's national library into a
    genuine people's library.

-   Hani used his work on Machiavelli, and more broadly Italy, to
    further his materialist interpretation analysis of history. In his
    introduction to Machiavelli, Machiavelli himself does not make an
    appearance until the second third of the book. He used this more
    harmless topic to conceal the otherwise "dangerous thoughts" that
    his class based analysis of city and country relations might have
    been seen as. After a long section reproducing German and other
    European Marxist interpretations of Florence and Italian history.

-   Like Rōyama, after an overview of the history of the idea of
    Machiavellianism in the West and various critics of Machiavelli,
    Hani assures readers that these portrayals of Machiavelli cannot
    even be found in the Prince if one reads closely, let alone the
    broader philosophy that stood behind his works, including the
    Discourses. His quotes from the Prince are usually those which
    emphasize the need for a prince to be loved by the people, as is
    found in chapter 19. Hani is particularly interested in
    Machiavelli's support for a people's militia as a "revolutionary"
    and transformative force in politics, perhaps suggesting his own
    hope for the potential political side effects of Japan's move
    towards total mobilization in the late 1930s. In his conclusion to
    readers he suggests that the heart of Machiavelli's philosophy is to
    be found in the Discourses part 1, chapter 55, in which Machiavelli
    argues that princes cannot reign where there is true equality among
    the people, and that government is not difficult to retain when its
    people are not corrupted.

-   In a separate 1930s introductory article on Machiavelli's thought
    Hani again suggests the radical potential for his thought. In the
    concluding paragraphs he argues that the Prince could be described
    as a text that could prepare leaders for "revolution" and "struggle"
    and which described the betrayals and political conspiracies that
    they would need to carry out their work. Machiavelli had, Hani
    suggested perhaps echoing Marx, attempted to understand history as
    politics alone.

-   There isn't time here to go into Hani's complex and eclectic postwar
    writings, but the Rennaissance and Machiavelli continue to be used
    as points of reference even when he was free to speak directly about
    contemporary and historical Japan in the postwar. As Sebastian
    Conrad has pointed out, Hani identified Japan's stagnation as a
    national trait, replacing earlier geographic determinism, and
    Machiavelli's discourses in particular may have provided him clues
    of how to provide a way out of this.[^8] In a well-known essay on
    the uniqueness of Japanese history, which focused in great part on
    the empire system in Japan, Hani concluded his essay by pointing to
    the republican traditions Japan could look to in the example of
    Sakai, a port near Osaka which experienced a long period of
    autonomous rule under its trading classes until the 16th century. He
    drew direct comparison between the experience of Sakai and western
    autonomous cities such as those of Rennaissance Italy.
